My name is Christopher Hench and I'm a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in German Literature and Medieval Studies. I did my undergraduate work in German and Economics at Middlebury College and have an MA in German and Scandinavian Studies from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. While in Massachusetts, I worked at the DEFA Film Library helping with productions and subtitling films. I've also taught English on a Fulbright in LÃ¼beck. I'm interested in medieval epics and love poetry, economic thinking and literature, and the tools of the Digital Humanities.
<br><br>
I also love programming. I teach and consult on Python, web scraping and APIs, and NLP at Berkeley's D-Lab. While these different interests do intersect in my work, I also don't mind working on them separately!
