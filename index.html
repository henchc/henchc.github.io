My name is Christopher Hench and I'm a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in German
Literature and Medieval Studies. I did my undergraduate work in German and
Economics at Middlebury College and have a Master's in German and Scandinavian
Studies from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. While in Massachusetts,
I worked at the DEFA Film Library helping with productions and subtitling
films. I've also taught English on a Fulbright in LÃ¼beck, Germany. I'm 
interested in medieval epics and love poetry, economic thinking and literature, 
and the tools of the Digital Humanities.
<br><br>
I also love programming. I teach and consult on Python, web scraping and APIs,
and NLP at Berkeley's D-Lab. While these different interests do intersect in 
my work, I also don't mind working on them separately!
<br><br>
<br><br>
What I'm working on now:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>the sound of middle high german</li>
  <li>intertextuality</li>
  <li>poetic meter</li>
</ul>
